## Description

This app is my second attempt at a frontend React shopping cart app. There is a landing page with all of the products, a page for individual product details, and a page for the shopping cart. This app also has a dummy paypal account to allow users to "buy" the products. Click [here](https://react-store-with-paypal.netlify.app/) to view the deployed app.

## Installation

Create the initial react using: npx create-react-app "someAppName"
To install dependencies you need to perform npm i

## Usage

![React shopping cart functionality](/public/assets/images/reactive-shopping-cart-functionality-gif.gif)

To use this app you will need to create a react app using create-react-app and install the dependencies using node.js. This app uses bootstrap for some of its components. I also included cart icon in the top right side to display when items are added to the cart that opens in another page.

I would like to eventually include a way to convert this into a full stack app and include a backend with authentication so the user can save their cart for later.
